        <blockquote>
<p>“Give me a whisky, ginger ale on the side. And don’t be stingy, baby!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And with that drink order, Greta Garbo spoke her first ever line in a talkie, 1930’s <em>Anna Christie</em>. “Garbo Talks!” screamed the ads! It was a big deal. So we also see that whisky and ginger ale is a classic combination. And with good reason: the burn of the ginger acts as a counter-irritant (as William Powell’s <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028010/">Godfrey</a> would say) to the burn of the booze, and the sweetness of the mixer gives the whole drink a nice lift.</p>
<p>My own connection with the drink is, however, much more personal: it was my Dad’s drink. He would have them when company was over, but I think his favorite time to have them was on the weekend, watching hockey games on TV. I was a precocious kid, and I learned at an early age, probably nine or ten, how to make them for him. My parents had these fancy tumblers with gold trim; there was a ring around each glass near the bottom, which I figured was the right fill line for the whisky. I’d then fill it up with Canada Dry ginger ale, no ice. I remember the first time I made him one, he approached the drink with caution, took a sip and then with a somewhat surprised expression, proclaimed it good. After that, for the next few years anyway, I would mix him the odd one while he watched those hockey games. Now I know that there will be people who are perhaps appalled at the thought of a young child mixing drinks for their father. That’s fine, but I really don’t care. It’s but one of many nostalgic memories I have of my father, who left this Earth in 2002.</p>
<p>In Canada, up through the 90s at least, which is when I left Ontario for NYC, Rye and Ginger is a popular drink. And ‘Rye’, in that context refers to Canadian whisky, which is very different from an American straight rye. My Dad didn’t really have a preference, I remember seeing Crown Royal (with the cool bag), Canadian Club, Seagram’s VO, and Seagram’s Five Star (with the cool plastic &quot;sheriff’s badge&quot;). I suspect that in the years since I left, Rye and Ginger may have become somewhat of an old man drink.</p>
<p>For my own version today, I’m going to skip the Canadian whisky and opt instead for an excellent NY state rye, <a href="https://brkdistilling.com/">Breuckelen Distilling</a> bottled in bond small batch. And I’m also subbing in my own house-made fermented ginger beer-- recipe to follow soon! My current batch of ginger beer isn't super carbonated yet (it's only been going for two days), but it has a lovely yeasty, slightly funky, honey and spice flavor profile. If I were served this blind, I would not guess in a million years that this is a two-ingredient drink.</p>

<h2>Variations</h2>
<p>For a classic Rye and Ginger, use Canadian whisky and commercial ginger ale. To make a Horse’s Neck, substitute brandy (classic) or bourbon (another variation), serve on the rocks and garnish with a long lemon twist, extending outside the rim of the glass.</p>
<p>Here’s to you, Dad!</p>
