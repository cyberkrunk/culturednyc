        <p>A guy walks into a bar:<br>
Bartender: &quot;What's yours?&quot;<br>
Guy: &quot;Old Pal.&quot;<br>
Bartender: &quot;Listen buddy, I don't know you from Adam. So I'll ask you again, what'll it be?&quot;<br>
Guy: &quot;I'd like an Old Pal, please.&quot;<br>
Bartender: &quot;What in hell is that?&quot;<br>
--end scene</p>
<p>Some version of this scene has been playing over and again for me, minus the Capra-esque patter, for many months now. I've been conducting a bit of an experiment, and have found that hardly anyone, bartenders included, knows how to make an Old Pal. I think the bartender at <a href="https://www.elixirsf.com/">Elixir</a>, a truly excellent bar in San Francisco, may have been the only one who remembered it. And that's a shame, because it's a great drink.</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of Negronis--they're my go-to when I'm looking for a gin cocktail that's as bracing as a slap across the face. A few years ago, I fell in love with Boulevardiers, which swap out the gin for bourbon. I was in Louisville for two weeks this summer, and had one of those pretty much everywhere I went. But Nora and I both have a preference for rye whiskey over bourbon, at least in cocktails, and that's where the Old Pal comes in. If you swap out the bourbon in a Boulevardier for rye, and also swap out the sweet vermouth for dry vermouth, now you have an Old Pal. This is exactly how I explain the drink to a bartender who doesn't know what an Old Pal is. If they also don't know how to make a Boulevardier, I'll order a whiskey on the rocks.</p>
<p>The drink was created by Harry MacElhone, of Harry's New York Bar in Paris, in honor of his friend and frequent customer, William &quot;Sparrow&quot; Robertson, a sports writer for the New York Herald. Robertson would call everyone his &quot;old pal,&quot; and the drink was named. The associations with Harry's and Paris in the '20s complete the allure of the drink for me.</p>

<p>Build in a tumbler filled with ice. Serve with a lemon twist for garnish.</p>
<p>Given the similarities between the Old Pal and the Boulevardier, I thought it would be instructive to mix up one of each and do a side-by-side comparison. I was expecting the Old Pal to be crisper and the Boulevardier to be sweeter, and I was blown away by how much that turned out to be the case. The Boulevardier was tasting almost like sweet cough syrup in comparison to the sleeker, racier Old Pal. I think I will keep ordering them!</p>
<p>And speaking of old pals, our friend Kara Newman has a great book, &quot;<a href="https://amzn.to/2NAP9LX">Shake. Stir. Sip.</a>&quot; which features the Old Pal, and about 50 other equal parts cocktails. It's worth checking out, as are all her books!</p>
