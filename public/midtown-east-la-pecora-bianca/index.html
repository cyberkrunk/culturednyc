        <div class="article-text">
        <p>After <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/29/dining/la-pecora-bianca-joins-the-italian-crowd.html">debuting its first location in NoMad</a> in 2015, the Midtown East branch of <a href="https://www.lapecorabianca.com/location/midtown/">La Pecora Bianca</a> opened with some neighborhood buzz in October 2017. I recall chatting about it in expectation with the folks across the street at <a href="https://www.sommtimewinebar.com/">Somm Time</a> just before opening. In the weeks afterward, it turned into somewhat of a hang for the somms, and it did for us too! The restaurant would feature locally-sourced produce and meat, pastas made with ancient and whole grains, and an Italian wine list. I have to admit that the first thing that caught my eye on the menu was <a href="http://www.produttoridelbarbaresco.com">Produttori del Barbaresco</a> by the glass. I had a feeling right then that this could be our kind of place.</p>
<p>We booked a table during opening week. Dining at a restaurant during opening is always interesting, because it’s not a question of whether things will go wrong—they will!—it’s a question of how the staff will handle them. On this night, our only tribulation was a bit of a wait for our table, and for this trouble we were offered a nice cheese plate as we waited by the bar. They passed the test with flying colors!</p>
<p>Since then, Pecora has found its way into our regular rotation. The food here is what you might call mainstream modern Italian. This is neither fine dining, nor old-school, but it’s good, and it leans healthy. We have sampled salads, pastas, fish and seafood, and while there haven’t been any dishes that we dream about at night (hello cacio e pere at <a href="https://felidia-nyc.com/">Felidia</a>!) everything is good enough to keep us coming back, the pastas in particular. I was pleased to see a bucatini cacio e pepe, previously a special, make it to the regular menu. Arancini have been on the menu since opening. While Pecora no longer offers Produttori by the glass, there is almost always a good Produttori, sometimes a reserve, available by the bottle, along with other solid Brunellos and Super-Tuscans. Cocktail service is good, and they pass the Plymouth gin test.</p>
<p>The main dining area is rather large, on the bright side and with a volume level approaching high (although nowhere near the cacophony of the nearby <a href="https://thesmithrestaurant.com/location/midtown/">Smith</a>). These are not our favorite attributes for a dining room, but somehow Pecora makes it all work. This is a very solid choice for entertaining out-of-town guests. Breakfasts and brunches, during which the scene is not as lively as dinner, are also good options.</p>
